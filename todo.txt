TODO:

# Redesign the folder structure: entities, dungeon-specific, UserInterfaces
# Explore the pygame library
# Use saved template code to generate grid as big as the dungeon map dimentions

Workflow:

# First input screen name
# then input file location
#   if file exists - validate
#   if not - upload until file exists
#   if file is valid - proceed
#   if not - upload until file is valid, then proceed
