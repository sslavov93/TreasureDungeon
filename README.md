# TreasureDungeon
The console game for the Python course assignment (FMI)

The project introduces a simple dungeon single-player game.
The protagonist is our hero, who is equipped with the strongest and most powerfully-enchanted weapon. In order to successfully complete the game, our hero must find the hidden treasure. Dangers await our hero as the dungeon is filled with bloodthirst orcs. Even if he manages to vaporise all evil within the dungen, our hero still needs to obtain the key to the chest which holds the ultimate treasure. Only then will he be able to emerge victorious from his quest.
